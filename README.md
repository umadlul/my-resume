## 🧠 Reflection on the Design

The intention behind this website was to create a resume that feels **visually modern**, **clean**, and **interactive**, while maintaining simplicity.  
I explored several UI ideas, including glowing navigation highlights, subtle animations, and a vertically centered layout to provide a more premium presentation.

Through building it, I learned how small animations can strongly improve user experience, and how important structure and spacing are when presenting personal information.  
This project helped refine my CSS animation skills, page-state handling using JavaScript, and understanding of user-friendly layout design.
